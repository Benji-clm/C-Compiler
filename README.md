# C-Compiler

Thhis repository contains three different compilers:

- A very [simple calculator](/C-Compiler/simple_calc) written in C.
- A slightly more advanced caluclator, [calculator 2](/C-Compiler/calculator_2), also written in C, that now implements an AST, combined with a compiler, an interpreter, and a graph make which all walk through the AST to perform the wanted logic.
- A [C-90](/C-compiler/C90_comp) written mainly in C++, which works as a subset of C, and able to compile more complex sturctures whilst emitting as target code RISC-V Assembly.

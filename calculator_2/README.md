# Calculator

This folder contains a significantly more complex calculator than the previous simple_calc. Major changes will include control constructs such as **if-else** and **while** statements. In addition, I will start working on constructing a syntax tree during parsing. After parsing, we walk the syntax tree to produce the ouput.

This calculator, for example, should be able tl perform the program:

```
x = 0;
while (x < 3) {
  print x;
  x = x + 1;
}
```

With ouptut being:

```
0
1
2
```
